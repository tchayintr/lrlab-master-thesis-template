This paper is an extended version of our preliminary paper \cite{chay-intr-etal-2021-character} presented in The $\text{13}^{\text{th}}$ Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2021). 
%
In this paper, we add detailed explanations and the following new information to the original one: BERT and recent domain-dependent Thai word segmentation in introduction; pre-trained model in Thai word segmentation in related work; explanation of BERT layers in approach; four non-neural models for comparison; two new domain-dependent datasets with their statistics for comparing our model with recent domain-dependent models; hyperparameters for pre-trained model integration; experimental results for pre-trained model integration, comparison of our model and recent Thai domain-dependency works on two domain-dependent datasets; analysis for pre-trained model integration results and domain-dependent comparison; population standard deviation in neural models; statistical significance tests for the strong baseline models on main results and analysis.
